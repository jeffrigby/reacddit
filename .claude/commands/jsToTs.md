# Convert a file from JSX to TSX

## Steps
- Reference @client/docs/JSX_TO_TSX_CONVERSION.md for best practices
- Make sure you are following all current best practices
- Make sure all linting passes before removing the original file
- Use the paths defined in the @client/tsconfig.json file

Before doing anything, ask me which file to convert. I will provide the file path.
