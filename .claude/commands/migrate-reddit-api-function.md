Migrate a function from @client/src/reddit/redditAPI.js to TypeScript in @client/src/reddit/redditApiTs.ts

- Convert the function to TypeScript
- Ensure it uses the correct types from @client/src/types/redditApi.ts
- Check that the types are accurate by using the Reddit API tester tool @reddit-api-tester/
- Do not worry about converting components or other files, just focus on the function migration
- Ensure the function is properly typed and follow best practices for TypeScript and the Reddit API
- Use websearch to find any additional information needed for the migration if necessary

Please ask me which function to migrate. I will provide the function name and any additional context needed.
