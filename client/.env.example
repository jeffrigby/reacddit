# The Public URL the app should run on.
PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000

# The API path. This can be relative or absolute
# If the path is url, port, scheme is different than the
# client you MUST set the ACCESS_CONTROL env variable on the
# server to match the path above.
# Valid examples:
#   http://localhost:3001/api
#   https://mydomain.com/api
#   https://api.mydomain.com
API_PATH=http://localhost:3001/api

# Optional Settings
# The host to listen to (custom domain for development)
HOST=mydomain.com

# What port the Vite dev server should listen on
PORT=3000

# What port the HMR WebSocket should connect to
# Default: 5173 (or PROXY_PORT if set in root .env)
# Set this when running behind a reverse proxy with a non-standard port
# Vite's HMR client will connect to wss://HOST:WSPORT instead of ws://localhost:3000
# Examples:
#   WSPORT=443   (for standard HTTPS port)
#   WSPORT=5173  (for default proxy port, same as PROXY_PORT default)
WSPORT=443
